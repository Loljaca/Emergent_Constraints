## Emergent_Constraints
We explore how CMIP5 models' ECS spread can be 'constrained' by different observable metrics. 

## Plan
This is going to be exciting!

## HadCRUT4 data set
Recent  developments  in  observational  near-surface  air  temperature  and  sea-surface  temperature analyses  are  combined  to  produce  HadCRUT4,  a  new data  set  of  global  and  regional  temperature evolution  from  1850  to  the  present.

Time series are monthly, annual and decadally smoothed series for each ensemble member of the HadCRUT4 ensemble (100).

Climate sensitivity is a measure for the response generated by the global climate system to a certain forcing e.g. a measure of the the change in global mean temperature when the atmospheric CO2 concentration is doubled.
