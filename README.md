## Why shall we care about emergent constraints in climate sensitivity? 
Climate sensitivity is a measure of the response of the global climate system to a certain forcing e.g. a measure of the change (increase) in global mean temperature when there is a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. IPCC: the value is around 3 degrees Celsius, depending on positive and negative feedback effects (sea ice, water vapour, clouds, greenhouse gases); without feedback effect, the change would be around 1 degree Celsius. In the long run the increase could be greater than 3 degrees since the CO2 concentration can be more than double, while in the short run the warming could be less due to the thermal inertia of the ocean.

We explore how CMIP5 models' ECS spread can be 'constrained' by different observable metrics. 

## Plan 
This is going to be exciting!


## HadCRUT4 data set
Recent  developments  in  observational  near-surface  air  temperature  and  sea-surface  temperature analyses  are  combined  to  produce  HadCRUT4,  a  new data  set  of  global  and  regional  temperature evolution  from  1850  to  the  present.

Time series are monthly, annual and decadally smoothed series for each ensemble member of the HadCRUT4 ensemble (100).
