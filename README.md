## Why shall we care about emergent constraints in climate sensitivity? 
Climate sensitivity is a measure of the response of the global climate system to a certain forcing e.g. a measure of the change (increase) in global mean temperature when there is a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. IPCC: the value is around 3 degrees Celsius, depending on positive and negative feedback effects (sea ice, water vapour, clouds, greenhouse gases); without feedback effect the change would be around 1 degree Celsius. In the long run the increase could be greater than 3 degrees since the CO2 concentration can be more than double, while in the short run the warming could be less due to the thermal inertia of the ocean.

Emergent Constraints idea: ...
 
## Aim
Find relevant emergent constraints and investigate their reliability. 

Particular case: global mean temperature variability. Reference: P. M. Cox, C. Huntingford, M. S. Williamson, Emergent constraint on equilibrium climate sensitivity from global temperature variability, Nature, 2018. 

Exploration: sea-land temperature variability. 

## Plan 
This is going to be exciting!

Step 1: Formulate the problem. Check available data. (see above)

Step 2: Find related literature. Discuss the methods involved and their adaptability to a different scenario. 

Step 3: Use the data to reproduce already validated experiments. 

Step 4: Elaborate a strategy for further explorations. 

## Methodology
CMIP5([Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip5/)):  experimental protocol for studying coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models which allows for a systematic analysis in terms of model diagnosis, comparison, model validation.
HadCRUT4 data set: 
Recent  developments  in  observational  near-surface  air  temperature  and  sea-surface  temperature analyses  are  combined  to  produce  HadCRUT4,  a  new data  set  of  global  and  regional  temperature evolution  from  1850  to  the  present.

Time series are monthly, annual and decadally smoothed series for each ensemble member of the HadCRUT4 ensemble (100).

We explore how CMIP5 models' ECS spread can be 'constrained' by different observable metrics.
